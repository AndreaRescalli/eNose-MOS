# Data Analysis for Temperature Controlled Electronic Nose
This repository contains all the code required to analyse the data collected with a temperature controlled/modulated electronic nose.
The repository is structured in two main folders:

- [mos-v1](mos-v1): Analysis done for the first set of experiments, that resulted in the paper [Temperature Modulation of MOS Sensors for Enhanced Detection of Volatile Organic Compounds](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9040/11/9/501)
- [mos-v2](mos-v2): Analysis done on the second set of experiments, comprising both single compounds and mixtures of compounds that resulted in the paper [AI-based Quantification of Volatile Organic Compounds in Gas Mixtures Exploiting Temperature Modulation of MOS Sensor Array](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11028944)
